# RetrOSMC-SteamController

Watchdog script to switch Steam Controller between Steam mode and Xbox mode.

If "steamlink.sh" is detected running, disables Xbox emulation mode and resets the controller.

Otherwise, will use Xbox mode, for Kodi/RetroPie/EmulationStation/everything else.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Hell-Fire/RetrOSMC-SteamController.git
cd RetrOSMC-SteamController
./install.sh
```
